# Chapter 2: Historical Volatility Estimation Methods

In the previous chapter, we learned about option volatility estimation and its importance in the world of finance. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at historical volatility estimation methods.

Historical volatility estimation is a way to calculate the volatility of an asset based on its past performance. As the name suggests, historical volatility is calculated using historical data of the asset's price movements. 

There are several methods that can be used to estimate historical volatility, including simple daily or weekly returns, log returns, weighted returns, and exponentially weighted moving averages. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and different methods may be more appropriate for different situations.

In this chapter, we will discuss the different historical volatility estimation methods in detail, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We will also provide code samples in Python to demonstrate how to implement these methods.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of historical volatility estimation methods and will be able to apply them in your own financial analysis. So, let's buckle up and get started!
# King Arthur and the Search for Accurate Historical Volatility

Once upon a time, King Arthur and his knights of the round table were faced with a challenging quest. The kingdom was in turmoil as merchants and traders were struggling to accurately predict the prices of goods and assets due to unstable markets. 

The king knew that having accurate historical data about volatility was vital for sophisticated price predictions. Thus, he summoned Sir Lancelot, the most knowledgeable member of the round table, to lead the quest for the most accurate historical volatility estimation method.

Sir Lancelot searched high and low for the best method, enlisting the help of his fellow knights. Sir Galahad used the simple daily returns method, which was easy to calculate but didn't capture the nuances of price fluctuations. Sir Percival suggested the weighted returns method which improved on simple returns but was still not quite accurate enough.

Just as they were losing hope, Sir Bedivere suggested they try the exponentially weighted moving average method, which took into account both recent and long-term price changes. The knights implemented the method and the results were astounding. Finally, they had found an accurate way to estimate historical volatility.

The kingdom rejoiced as merchants and traders could now predict prices with greater accuracy, bringing stability and prosperity to the land. King Arthur was grateful to his knights for their persistence and hard work, and Sir Lancelot was recognised and rewarded for his leadership.

The round table had prevailed in their quest and had learned an important lesson: there is no one-size-fits-all approach to historical volatility, and it's important to try different methods to find the one that works best for the situation.

And so ends the tale of King Arthur and the Search for Accurate Historical Volatility. May it serve as a reminder of the importance of data analysis and the value of persistence in the face of challenges.
# Explanation of the Code

In the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the knights used different methods to estimate historical volatility before finding the most accurate method - the exponentially weighted moving average.

Here is an example of code in Python that implements this method:

```python
import pandas as pd

# create a DataFrame with price data
prices = [10.3, 10.1, 10.2, 10.5, 10.9, 11.1, 11.2, 11.5, 11.4, 11.6]
df = pd.DataFrame(prices, columns=['Price'])

# calculate daily returns
df['Returns'] = df['Price'].pct_change()

# calculate the exponentially weighted moving average with half-life of 3 days
ewma_3d = df['Returns'].ewm(halflife=3).std()

print('Historical volatility (exponentially weighted moving average):', ewma_3d)
```

In this code, we start by creating a DataFrame called `df` with price data. We then calculate the daily returns using the `pct_change()` method in Pandas.

To calculate the exponentially weighted moving average, we use the `ewm()` method with a halflife parameter of 3 days. The `std()` method is used to calculate the standard deviation.

Finally, we print out the result which is the historical volatility using the exponentially weighted moving average method.

This is just one example of how to implement the exponentially weighted moving average method in Python. It's important to note that the choice of the halflife parameter can have a significant impact on the result, and different values may be more appropriate for different situations.

Overall, the code sample demonstrates how to implement historical volatility estimation using the exponentially weighted moving average method, which proved to be the most accurate method for the knights of the round table in their quest for stability and prosperity.
