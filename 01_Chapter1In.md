# Chapter 1: Introduction to Option Volatility Estimation ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the world of option volatility estimation! In this chapter, we'll be exploring the basics of option volatility estimation, what it is, why it's important, and how it can be used to unlock opportunities in derivative markets.

But first, let us introduce you to our special guest for this chapter, Emanuel Derman, one of the most influential quants of our time. Derman has made significant contributions to many different areas of quantitative finance and authored numerous books on the subjects, including "My Life as a Quant" and "Models Behaving Badly." He has also been a professor at Columbia University and a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs!

Now, let's dive in and learn about option volatility estimation!

## What is Option Volatility Estimation?

Option volatility estimation is the process of calculating the implied volatility of an option. Implied volatility is the market's expectation for how much the price of the underlying asset will move over a certain period of time.

Implied volatility can be calculated using different models, such as the Black-Scholes model or the binomial model. These models use inputs such as the current price of the underlying asset, the strike price, time until expiration, and interest rates to calculate the value of an option and, in turn, its implied volatility.

## Why is Option Volatility Estimation Important?

Option volatility estimation is important because it can provide valuable information about market expectations for future price movements. Traders can use implied volatility to identify potential trading opportunities and manage risk by adjusting their positions accordingly.

For example, if implied volatility is high, it could indicate that there is a greater probability of large price swings in the underlying asset, meaning that traders may consider hedging their positions or taking advantage of potential profit opportunities. On the other hand, if implied volatility is low, it may suggest that the market expects a relatively stable or unchanged price of the underlying asset.

## How is Option Volatility Estimated?

There are different ways to estimate implied volatility, but one common method is to use the Black-Scholes formula or a similar model to solve for the implied volatility that makes the calculated option price match the observed market price. This process is called "implied volatility solving."

Here's an example of how to estimate implied volatility in Python using the Black-Scholes formula:

```python
from scipy.stats import norm
from math import log, sqrt, exp

def black_scholes_call(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    d1 = (log(S/K) + (r + sigma**2/2)*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma*sqrt(T)
    return S * norm.cdf(d1) - K * exp(-r*T) * norm.cdf(d2)

def black_scholes_implied_vol(S, K, T, r, C):
    error = lambda sigma: (black_scholes_call(S, K, T, r, sigma) - C)**2
    return fminbound(error, 0, 100)
```

Here, `black_scholes_call` calculates the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes formula, and `black_scholes_implied_vol` estimates the implied volatility given the observed market price `C`.

To call this code, we'll just need to input the relevant option parameters and market price:

```python
S = 100 # underlying asset price
K = 105 # strike price
r = 0.05 # risk-free interest rate
T = 0.5 # time to expiration (in years)
C = 8.02 # observed market price

implied_vol = black_scholes_implied_vol(S, K, T, r, C)
print(f'Implied volatility: {implied_vol:.2%}')
```

This will output the estimated implied volatility of the option, which can be used to inform our trading decisions.

## Conclusion

We hope that this has provided you with a solid foundation for understanding this crucial aspect of derivative trading.

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Option Volatility Estimation ðŸ“ˆ

In ancient times, the gods of finance were said to have bestowed upon humanity a powerful tool for anticipating change and managing risk: option volatility.

As the story goes, the great quant god Emanuel Derman spun the Wheel of Risk to create the first option contract, imbuing it with the power to estimate future volatility of assets. He then summoned the winged god of finance, Mercury, to deliver the option contract to the mortals on earth.

Upon its arrival, the mortals were initially hesitant to use the newfound power of option volatility. But as they began to understand its potential, they started to employ it with great success in managing their investments and protecting their wealth. Over time, the use of option volatility spread across the land, becoming an indispensable tool for traders and investors alike.

But as with any tool of great power, there were those who sought to misuse option volatility for their own gain. Some tried to manipulate the market by spreading false rumors to drive up volatility and cash in on the resulting price swings. Others used complex models to estimate volatility, making huge profits but leaving a trail of chaos in their wake.

Eventually, the gods of finance grew concerned about the consequences of unchecked option volatility. They convened a council and summoned the wise goddess of wisdom, Athena, to devise a solution. After much contemplation, Athena proposed a new framework for option volatility estimation, using sound principles of statistics and risk management.

The gods of finance were impressed by Athena's plan and quickly set about implementing it. They created new models and algorithms based on her principles, improving the accuracy and reliability of option volatility estimation. And they instructed the mortals on earth to use these new tools wisely and responsibly, to ensure the continued prosperity of their society.

And so it was that the power of option volatility was harnessed for the greater good, thanks to the wisdom of the gods and the guidance of their special guest, Emanuel Derman.

Of course! The code used in the story to estimate option implied volatility is an implementation of the Black-Scholes model, one of the most commonly used models for option pricing and volatility estimation.

The Black-Scholes model uses an equation to relate the price of an option to its underlying asset, the option's strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. Specifically, it calculates the expected value of a call or put option as a function of these parameters, assuming that the price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion over time.

Given an observed market price of an option, we can use the Black-Scholes equation to solve for the implied volatility of the option that yields the observed price. This process is known as "implied volatility solving."

The code above defines two functions: `black_scholes_call` and `black_scholes_implied_vol`. The `black_scholes_call` function calculates the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes formula, given an underlying asset price (`S`), strike price (`K`), time to expiration (`T`), risk-free interest rate (`r`), and volatility (`sigma`).

The `black_scholes_implied_vol` function estimates the implied volatility of an option for a given market price (`C`), using the `black_scholes_call` function to solve for the implied volatility that makes the calculated call price match the observed market price.

The `error` lambda function within the `black_scholes_implied_vol` function defines the squared difference between the calculated call price and the observed market price as the 'error'. Then, the `fminbound` function from the `scipy.optimize` library is used to find the minimum value of the error function, which corresponds to the value of `sigma` that solves for the implied volatility.

Overall, this code is a useful tool for calculating option implied volatility using the Black-Scholes equation in Python.
