# Chapter 5: Advanced Greeks Estimation

Welcome back from the previous chapter, where we learnt about the foundational concept of `Greeks` and how to calculate them for financial instruments.

In this chapter, we are going to delve deeper into the world of `option Greeks`. We will learn how to estimate and model the sensitivity of options to various parameters.

To start things off, let's welcome a very special guest in this chapter - **Nassim Nicholas Taleb**. Mr. Taleb is a celebrated author and former options trader with a keen interest in risk and uncertainty. His groundbreaking book, `The Black Swan`, introduced the concept of 'anti-fragility' - the idea that some things actually thrive on uncertainty.

Mr. Taleb's contribution to the world of finance is not limited to his writings alone. He is also known for his development of an options pricing model known as `The Black-Scholes-Merton Model`. This model transformed the way options were priced and traded, paving the way for derivatives to become one of the most significant financial products in the modern market.

Mr. Taleb's groundbreaking work on the topic of `Greeks` has received acclamation from experts in the field of options trading. His research has shaped our understanding of the nature of risk and the importance of accurate and precise estimation of financial parameters.

In this chapter, we will be drawing from Mr. Taleb's insights and learn how to implement his concepts to estimate various `Greeks`. We will be using Python to demonstrate the calculations of Advanced Greeks Estimation.

So, what are you waiting for? Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for an exciting journey into the world of `Advanced Greeks Estimation`!
# Chapter 5: Advanced Greeks Estimation

## The Story of Gamma, Theta and Vega

Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there was a great warrior named Gamma. He was known for his sharp mind and his ability to predict how the value of options would change in response to shifts in the underlying asset's volatility.

One day, Gamma met Theta, another great warrior. Theta was very wise and was a master of time decay. He could predict how the value of options would change as time moved forward.

The two warriors realized that they complemented each other perfectly. Together, they were unstoppable. They decided to join forces and embark on a new adventure.

They soon met Vega, a beautiful and intelligent warrior who had an uncanny ability to predict how the value of options would change in response to shifts in the implied volatility. Vega had learned this from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a wise and powerful wizard who had taught her the secrets of option pricing.

Together, Gamma, Theta, and Vega became the best of friends and embarked on a quest to help traders and investors everywhere by teaching them the secrets of option pricing.

## The Resolution

The trio learned that, while their skills were impressive independently, when combined, they were even more powerful. They used their skills to build models that could estimate the value of options under different market conditions. They taught their skills to others, making it possible for traders everywhere to make more informed investment decisions.

In their quest to help the trading community, they also partnered with Taleb to advance the field of option pricing. Taleb taught them about the importance of anti-fragility and how to build models that could withstand unexpected market shifts, protecting traders from large losses.

Through their efforts, Gamma, Theta, and Vega became known throughout the kingdom as the experts in options pricing. Even the most seasoned traders would turn to them for advice and guidance.

As their adventures continued, they continued to explore new ways of predicting the future of the market. They were determined to make trading more accessible and less risky.

And so, their story continues. Who knows what adventures and challenges Gamma, Theta, Vega and Taleb have in store? One thing is for sure â€“ the principles they have developed will continue to guide traders everywhere to make smart, informed investment decisions.
## Code Explanation

In the above story, Gamma, Theta and Vega were able to make accurate predictions about the value of options using different pricing models. In order to work with these pricing models, we need to understand how to estimate value and risk sensitivities, also known as the `Greeks`.

### Estimating Gamma

Gamma is a second-order `Greek` that represents the sensitivity of the option's delta to changes in the underlying asset's price. It measures how the option's delta will change in response to a change in the price of the underlying asset. The formula for estimating Gamma is as follows:

      def gamma(S, K, T, r, sigma):
          d1 = (np.log(S/K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
          gamma = norm.pdf(d1) / (S * sigma * np.sqrt(T))
          return gamma

Here, `S` is the spot price of the underlying asset, `K` is the strike price, `T` is the time to maturity, `r` is the risk-free interest rate, `sigma` is the volatility of the underlying asset's returns. `norm.pdf(d1)` is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution evaluated at `d1`.

### Estimating Theta

Theta measures the sensitivity of the option's value to the passage of time. It represents how much the option's price changes as time passes. The formula for estimating Theta is as follows:

    def theta(S, K, T, r, sigma):
          d1 = (np.log(S/K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
          d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
          theta = -(S * norm.pdf(d1) * sigma) / (2 * np.sqrt(T)) - r * K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2)
          return theta

Here `norm.cdf(d2)` is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution evaluated at `d2`.

### Estimating Vega

Vega measures the sensitivity of the option's value to changes in the underlying asset's volatility. It represents how much the option's price changes as the volatility of the underlying asset changes. The formula for estimating Vega is as follows:

    def vega(S, K, T, r, sigma):
          d1 = (np.log(S/K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
          vega = S * norm.pdf(d1) * np.sqrt(T)
          return vega

Here we calculate the `Black-Scholes` value of the option, and then take the derivative of this value with respect to the underlying asset's volatility.

By estimating these Greeks, traders and investors can better understand the value and risk associated with options. These estimates help them make more informed investment decisions and hedge their risks effectively.
