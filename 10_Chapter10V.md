## Chapter 10: Volatility Term Structure

Welcome back dear readers! I hope you found the previous chapter on Volatility Skew both informative and entertaining. Today, we will delve deeper into the world of option volatility estimation and discuss the concept of Volatility Term Structure. 

But before that, we have a special guest joining us to shed some light on this subject. Emanuel Derman is a renowned quantitative analyst, author, and professor at Columbia University. He has published various research papers, books, and articles on the subject of quantitative finance. Emanuel has agreed to share his thoughts and insights on Volatility Term Structure, so let's get started!

Volatility term structure refers to the pattern of implied volatilities for options with the same underlying asset, but with different expiration dates. In simpler terms, it is the way in which the implied volatility of an option changes depending on its maturity date. 

The term structure can be either upward sloping (also known as Contango) or downward sloping (also known as Backwardation). There is also a flat or horizontal term structure, which is relatively rare, but we’ll get to that later. 

Understanding the volatility term structure can be of great importance for many market participants, particularly those who are using options to hedge their portfolio. The term structure can provide valuable insights into future market expectations, as well as the sentiment and risk aversion levels of investors.

The volatility term structure is closely related to the concept of Interest Rate Parity, which states that the difference in interest rates between two currencies should be reflected in the forward exchange rate. Similarly, the difference in implied volatility between two options expiring at different times should be reflected in the price differential between the two options.

In this chapter, we will explore the factors that influence the term structure, as well as the various models and techniques that are commonly used to estimate it.

So, sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and let’s hear some wisdom from Emanuel Derman on Volatility Term Structure. I promise you won’t be disappointed!
## Robin Hood and the Volatility Term Structure

Once upon a time, in the village of Sherwood, Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws were enjoying their usual routine of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. However, Robin was worried about the future and the security of his band. He heard rumors of impending market volatility and wanted to hedge his positions. 

That's when Emanuel Derman came to Sherwood. Hearing about Robin Hood's dilemma, Emanuel suggested using options to hedge their positions. But Robin was confused about the different options available and their volatilities. Emanuel explained to him the concept of the volatility term structure and how it could help them make more informed decisions.

Robin and his band soon realized that understanding the volatility term structure could help them predict future market expectations and identify the sentiment and risk aversion levels of investors. They were keen to learn more about the models and techniques used to estimate the term structure.

Emanuel then introduced them to the popular models like the Black-Scholes model, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity), and Implied Volatility Surfaces. He explained how these models are used to estimate the volatility term structure and which factors influenced the term structure.

Robin was pleased to learn that the term structure could be used to identify the right options to buy or sell and optimize his hedges. He learnt that when the term structure is in Contango, it typically means that the further-out options have higher volatility and can be sold to take advantage of the higher premiums. Similarly, when the term structure is in Backwardation, it typically means that the near-term options have higher volatility and can be sold for more premiums.

Emboldened by this new knowledge, Robin and his band made the right decisions and successfully hedged their positions. Thanks to Emanuel, they gained a deeper understanding of option volatility estimation and its importance in hedging.

And so, our story ends with Robin and his band of outlaws happily celebrating their newfound financial knowledge and implementing it for the benefit of themselves and the poor villagers of Sherwood.
## Code Explanation: Volatility Term Structure

In order to estimate the volatility term structure, we need to use certain models and estimation techniques. Let's take a look at some commonly used techniques:

- **Black-Scholes Model**: This model is used to calculate the theoretical values of European-style call and put options. The model relies on assumptions like constant volatility, no transaction costs or taxes, no dividends and precise control over the stock price. While this model is widely used and served as the groundwork for many option pricing models, it has several limitations.

- **GARCH**: GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. This model is used to estimate the volatility of an asset based on its own past volatility. It assumes that the variance of the error terms of a time series is a function of both past errors and past variances. GARCH is widely used for modeling financial time series data, especially in studying volatility patterns.

- **Implied Volatility Surfaces**: Implied volatility is the volatility of an underlying asset that is implied by the prices of options connected with it. Implied Volatility Surfaces are the graphical representation of implied volatilities for a given stock, at different strike prices and expiry dates. The surface shows how implied volatility changes as the strike price and expiry date change. The aim of implied volatility surfaces is to estimate the relationship between volatility and time to expiry and strike price.

There are other models as well, but these are some of the commonly used models. In order to estimate the volatility term structure, you can use these models or a combination of these models.

Here is a sample Python code that uses the Black-Scholes Model to estimate the volatility term structure:

```
from scipy.stats import norm
from math import log, sqrt, exp

# Define the variables
S = 100 # Stock Price
K = 100 # Strike Price
r = 0.05 # Risk-Free Interest Rate
T = 1 # Time to Maturity
C = 10 # Call Option Price

# Define the Black-Scholes Function
def BS(S, K, r, T, sigma):
    d1 = (log(S / K) + (r + sigma ** 2 / 2) * T) / (sigma * sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * sqrt(T)
    return (S * norm.cdf(d1) - K * exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2))

# Define the implied volatility function using Newton-Raphson method
def implied_vol(C, S, K, T, r):
    sig = 0.5
    sig_next = 0
    while abs(sig - sig_next) > 0.000001:
        price = BS(S, K, r, T, sig)
        vega = S * norm.pdf((log(S / K) + (r + sig ** 2 / 2) * T) / (sig * sqrt(T))) * sqrt(T)
        sig_next = sig - (price - C) / vega
        sig = sig_next
    return sig

# Compute the implied volatilities for different maturities and strikes
strikes = range(80, 120, 5)
maturities = range(1, 31)
vol_surfaces = {}
for maturity in maturities:
    row = []
    for strike in strikes:
        C = BS(S, strike, r, maturity / 365.0, 0.4) # Compute call option price
        implied_volatility = implied_vol(C, S, strike, maturity / 365.0, r) # Compute implied volatility
        row.append(implied_volatility)
    vol_surfaces[maturity] = row

# Plot the implied volatility surface
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
X, Y = np.meshgrid(strikes, maturities)
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, vol_surfaces.values())
plt.show()
```

In this code, we define the variables like Stock Price, Risk-Free Interest Rate, Time to Maturity, etc. and we define the Black-Scholes Function to calculate the theoretical values of European-style call and put options.

Then, we define the implied volatility function using the Newton-Raphson method to compute the implied volatility of an option. Finally, we compute the implied volatilities for different maturities and strikes and plot the implied volatility surface.

This is just a sample code that uses the Black-Scholes model. There are other models and techniques that you can use to estimate the volatility term structure. However, this code gives a basic idea of how to estimate the volatility term structure using the Black-Scholes model.
