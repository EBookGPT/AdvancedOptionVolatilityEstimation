# Chapter 12: Conclusion and Future Trends

Congratulations! You made it to the end of this book on Advanced Option Volatility Estimation. We hope that you have found the preceding chapters engaging and have learned something new about estimating volatility from options prices. Now, let's summarize some key takeaways and discuss future trends in this field.

## Key Takeaways

Throughout the book, we have covered various methods for estimating volatility that include parametric, non-parametric, and hybrid models. We explored the Black-Scholes model and its assumptions, how to use the implied volatility surface, and how to analyze and manage volatility risk. Additionally, we dived into some popular strategies that utilize volatility estimations.

By now, you should understand that no single model can universally fit all financial instruments, and it is critical to decide on a proper method depending on the financial instrument and market conditions. Additionally, we hope that you appreciate the importance of volatility in option pricing and risk management.

## Future Trends

The study of volatility has come a long way since the discovery of the Black-Scholes model. Over the years, advancements in computational technology and data have allowed for more complex and sophisticated models to arise. There is still so much more to be done to improve volatility estimation, but we will give you some insights into what we believe will be the future trends.

Firstly, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly being adopted in finance, and volatility estimation is no exception. The use of ML and DL can make use of big data to uncover hidden patterns within option prices and result in more accurate volatility forecasts.

Secondly, conventional volatility models assume that underlying price returns are normally distributed. However, this assumption is often violated in practice. New models that account for asymmetry, leptokurtosis, and heteroscedasticity can be used in tandem with ML and DL techniques to improve volatility estimation.

Lastly, volatility estimation is essential in many financial applications, such as option pricing, risk management, and asset allocation. We anticipate more research on combining volatility estimation with other quantitative disciplines to enable better and more efficient investment decision-making.

## Conclusion

Thank you for joining us on this journey of Advanced Option Volatility Estimation. We hope that you have gained valuable insights and will use this knowledge to improve your trading and investment strategies. Remember, volatility is a crucial factor in pricing options, and it is an essential aspect for risk management. It is vital to choose the right method to fit your financial instrument and market conditions.

Now, go ahead and put your knowledge into practice!
# Chapter 12: Conclusion and Future Trends

Once upon a time, Dr. Frankenstein had a brilliant idea to combine the best parts of various creatures to create a superbeing. He spent many years conducting research and analyzing data, using the most advanced technologies of his time. After many trials and errors, he finally assembled a creature that exceeded his expectations in every way.

However, Dr. Frankenstein failed to take into consideration the implications of combining different creatures. His creation, filled with potential and power, was too unpredictable, and it made him realize how important it was to have a well-thought-out plan.

Just like Dr. Frankenstein, those who trade options have to be aware of the complex interplay between different factors that influence the estimation of volatility. Developed and sophisticated models will be like Frankenstein's creature, but without proper management, it can prove to be too formidable.

So, how do we take these future trends and put them into practice? How can we create less unpredictable models to trade options? In order to avoid the mistakes of Dr. Frankenstein and make sure our models don't turn on us, we should take a few key steps:

- Choose the appropriate method based on the financial instrument.
- Adapt our models constantly to the changing environment by reviewing our models' performance often.
- Continuously monitor recent research, trends, and industry experts.

Following these critical steps, we can make better decisions while trading options and reduce our risk of losses. By implementing these processes along with the use of machine learning, deep learning, and new volatility models that account for changes in the distribution of returns, we can stay ahead in this field of option trading.

In conclusion, the field of option trading has seen many advances in volatility estimation over the years, and thereâ€™s still so much more research to be done in the future. We hope that our exploration and future prediction of these trends will help you make better decisions in managing and estimating volatility. Just remember not to make the same mistake as Dr. Frankenstein, and always have a well-thought-out plan for any model you choose to implement.
In the Frankenstein story, Dr. Frankenstein's creation was too unpredictable due to the complex interplay between different creatures. Similarly, when estimating volatility for options, there are various models and methods to choose from, and it can become too complicated without proper management.

Here, we will introduce a sample code snippet to utilize machine learning for volatility estimation: 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load log returns data
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
log_returns = np.log(df['Close'].values) - np.log(df['Close'].shift(1).values)

# Create volatility labels
vol_labels = pd.DataFrame(data=[np.nan]*len(df), columns=['Volatility'])
for i in range(5, len(df)):
    vol_labels['Volatility'][i-1] = np.std(log_returns[i-5:i])

# Create features
window_lengths = [20, 40, 60]
features = pd.DataFrame(data=[np.nan]*len(df), columns=['Feature'])
for w in window_lengths:
    centered_log_returns = log_returns - np.mean(log_returns)
    rolling_std = centered_log_returns.rolling(w).std()
    feature_values = log_returns / rolling_std
    features['Feature'] = np.where(np.isnan(features['Feature']), feature_values, features['Feature'])

# Train model
train_features = features[60:3000]
train_volatility = vol_labels['Volatility'][60:3000]
regression = LinearRegression().fit(train_features, train_volatility)

# Predict volatility
test_features = features[3000:3500]
predicted_volatility = regression.predict(test_features)
```

In the code above, we first load the log returns data and create label data by calculating the standard deviation of log returns over the past 5 days as the volatility levels. 

Next, features are generated by carrying out calculations that include window lengths of 20, 40, and 60, based on the log returns data. These features will determine the characteristics of our estimates.

The model is then trained with the available data, and now we can predict the volatility levels by creating our test set with features from 3000 to 3500, as specified in the code.

Utilizing machine learning algorithms in volatility estimation like this helps create less unpredictable models to trade options, thus proving to be much more useful instead of a volatile Frankenstein's monster.
